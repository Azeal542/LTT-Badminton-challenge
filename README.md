This project was based on a clip from the WAN Show on LTT where they did a challenge "VIbe Coder vs Professional Coder" and it seemed like a fun challenge to take on as the "Professional Coder".

This project is built fully in Python using tkinter as the GUI and csv files as the database. 

Features will be added as I think of them.
